You're probably thinking you can steal the votes he needs in the South, aren't you? Let's see how it goes.</p>

You couldn't help but lay dormant in agony for years after the house voted in favor of Muskie by a slim majority. What caused your defeat? Well, besides the obvious, like the Cambodia leaks. It was the conservative protest of some 30 representatives that betrayed the party and voted for Bill Rusher. It's starting to make sense. Rusher never planned to start a new party his goal was to get you out of the way and open the field for Reagan. Now you feel you're entitled to at least try to get back at them.
